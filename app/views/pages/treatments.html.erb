  <p>- <strong>Regular Medical Care</strong>  This type of care could include routine tests like blood work and x-ray studies.  It could include medications, intravenous fluids, nutrition, and blood transfusions. </p>

  <p>- <strong>Advanced Life Support</strong>  This would include respirators, hemodialysis machines and medications for treating shock.  You typically have to be in an intensive care unit to receive these therapies. </p>

  <p>- <strong>Invasive Care</strong> This would include invasive procedures performed like surgery and heart catheterizations.</p>

  <p>- <strong>Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation</strong>  This is what is done when you have a cardiac arrest.  This includes chest compressions, shocking the heart, putting a breathing tube in and giving you medications.</p>

  <p>- <strong>Comfort Care</strong>  This means you will only be given medications that can ease your suffering and keep you comfortable.  All other medications, labs and tests are stopped.</p>
